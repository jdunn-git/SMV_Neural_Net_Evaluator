Usage:  nuXmv [-h | -help] [options]* [input_file]
   -h | -help
      prints out current message
   -AG
      enables AG only search
   -bdd_soh heuristics
      sets the static variable ordering heuristics to "heuristics"
   -bmc
      enables BMC instead of BDD model checking
   -bmc_length k

      enables cone of influence reduction
   -cp cp_t
      conjunctive partitioning with threshold of each partition set to "cp_t" (DEFAULT, 
      with cp_t=1000). Use -thresh instead of this.
      NOTE: Incompatible with options -iwls95 -mono -thresh
      WARNING: option "-cp" is deprecated
   -cpp
      runs preprocessor on SMV files before any specified with -pre. Environment 
      variable 'CPP' can be used to specify a different preprocessor.
      WARNING: option "-cpp" is deprecated
   -ctt
      enables checking for the totality of the transition relation
   -dcx
      disables computation of counter-examples
   -df
      disables the computation of reachable states
      NOTE: Incompatible with option -f
   -disable_daggifier
      disables the SMV model dumper daggifier
   -disable_sexp2bdd_caching
      disables caching of expressionsevaluation to BDD
   -disable_syntactic_checks
      Skips some correctness checks over the input model. Warning: when using this 
      option, the input model MUST be correct, otherwise the tool may crash
   -dynamic
      enables dynamic reordering of variables
   -f
      computes the reachable states (forward search) (default)
      NOTE: Incompatible with option -df
      WARNING: option "-f" is deprecated
   -flt
      computes the reachable states also for the LTL Tableau
   -i iv_file
      reads order of variables from file "iv_file"
   -ic
      does not check COMPUTE
   -ii
      does not check INVARSPEC
   -ils
      does not check LTLSPEC
   -int
      enables interactive mode
   -ips
      does not check PSLSPEC
   -is
      does not check SPEC
   -iwl95preorder
      enables iwls95 preordering
   -iwls95 cp_t
      enables Iwls95 conjunctive partitioning and sets
      NOTE: Incompatible with options -thresh -mono -cp
   -keep_single_value_vars
      Does not convert variables that have only one single possible value into constant 
      DEFINEs
   -load sc_file
      executes NuSMV commands from file
      NOTE: Incompatible with option -source
      WARNING: option "-load" is deprecated
   -lp
      lists all properties in SMV model
   -m method
      sets the variable ordering method to "method". Reordering will be activated
   -mono
      enables monolithic transition relation
      NOTE: Incompatible with options -thresh -iwls95 -cp
   -n idx
      specifies which property of SMV model should be checked
   -noaffinity
      disables affinity clustering
   -o ov_file
      prints order of variablesto file "ov_file"
   -obm bn_file
      prints boolean model to file "bn_file"
   -ofm fn_file
      prints flattened model to file "fn_file"
   -ojeba str
      sets the algorthim used for BDD-based language emptiness of Buchi fair transition 
      systems (default is EL_bwd). The available algorthims are: EL_fwd, EL_bwd
   -old
      keeps backward compatibility with older versions of NuSMV
   -old_div_op
      enables the old semantics of "/" and "mod" operations instead of ANSI C semantics
   -pre pp_list
      defines a space-separated list of pre-processors to run (in the order given)
